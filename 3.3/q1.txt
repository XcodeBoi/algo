Question 1

In many systems, the number of requests for some processing to occur outstrips the available computation resources. A queue is appropriate as processing should happen in a set order, the order a program requests the processing to occur. If the processor had no queue, routines would frequently be dropped or incomplete - which in the vast majority of cases is inappropriate.

is_empty: Queue -> Boolean

Allows the program to run some kind of subroutine if the processor of said queue has nothing to do, improving efficiency.

first: Queue -> item

Allows for the processing of a queue to occur, in which is required in the vast majority of use cases

length: Queue -> Integer

Another example of a property that could be used to run a subroutine, such as in a processing queue an ETA for completion
