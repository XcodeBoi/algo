Question 2

A priority queue allows for items in a queue to be ranked by some kind of property or routine.

In a medical administration system, some cases are going to be of more importance than others but need to be processed sequentially. This is practically the definition of a priority queue.

At an airport, the various runways could be considered as priority queues. Each element could be a data structure representing an Aircraft's intentions, including take off/landing status, direction, predicted time taken, emergency medical issues or emergency mechanical issues. The properties on these aircraft would rank their position in the queue.

More broadly, all the runways could be presented as a priority queue with things like direction of take off causing planes further back to jump forward in the queue if element one cannot take off from the free runway.
